Questions refer to the parts of the assignment

Question 1 prompt: Write a server program and a client program. The client sends the weight
and height for a person to the server. The server computes BMI (Body Mass Index) and
sends back to the client a string that reports the BMI. You can use the following formula
for computing BMI

Question 2 prompt: Revise the server program in Question-1 using threads to allow multiple
clients

Question 3 prompt:  Implement the following generic method for linear search (return the first
index value if the key is found in the list, return -1 otherwise).

Note: For questions 1 and 2, I was under the assumption that the height and weight needed to be entered in using the text field, so set it so height and weight are set by typing the height, a space, then the weight (which is stated in the label)
